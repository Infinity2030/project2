# Personal Portfolio -- Bookstore Management Project

This project is a bookstore management system that I built to strengthen
my Python programming skills and explore how object‑oriented design,
backend logic, and graphical interfaces come together to form a full
application. I designed the system in a way that feels clean,
structured, and scalable, allowing me to practice the fundamentals of
organizing real‑world data such as books, customers, and transactions.
Building this project helped me understand how to break down complex
tasks into classes and methods, test functionality properly, and connect
backend logic to a user‑friendly GUI. It also represents an important
step in my journey toward becoming better at creating complete,
functional Python applications.

# Video Demo

I will be adding a full YouTube video walkthrough here, explaining the
code structure, GUI interactions, and how each feature works in the
bookstore system.
